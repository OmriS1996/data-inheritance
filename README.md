# Strapi plugin data-inheritance

Current used files:
./server/middlewares/dataInherit.ts
./server/register.ts

The first file is the actual plugin logic, the second is a life cycle method to register that middleware to the main app.
The rest of the files are simply part of Strapi's plugin template.
